everything is a list
in theory we could have horizontal lists, but in practice this isn't that useful
each row has a fixed number of fixed width cells. The number of columns and their widths and  can change as the user zooms or resizes (e.g. maps).


we can have a list in lists
inner lists should not scroll (this is not a good user experience)
options are:
 more 
 paginate
 open in a new list (can replace the tapped column)


we can display multiple columns of lists (e.g. discord thread, mac finder)

overlays can be anchored to list cells.



Table cells can be formatted to "spill" into neighboring cells and have z-order.
