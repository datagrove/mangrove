Datagrove also supports secure discussions (Because you needed one more message silo(😂)[ https://xkcd.com/927/]). We are trying to innovate in this space though. We offer the security of Signal (end to end encryption) with the power of Discord, and a new feature we call "concierge edgesites". 


## Advanced Geekery

Datagrove is completely open source so you are never locked in. At any point you can take your data to any host you like or no host at all. At the end of this tutorial we will show you how you can move your data to Amazon Lightsail. If you end up hosting your edgesite somewhere else please share your experience and help us add more tutorials like this.

Also you can improve your security against certain threats by generating identities yourself on an airgapped machine. You can also improve it by disallowing web browsers and only using specific edge devices, such as IOS devices or PinePhone. See our Github for details.



// this needs to be set from the tab? should we use location instead?
// for the most part setSite should just set a url, then the datagrove machinery should load the data.

// every site will be named org-site.froov.net/{branch|snapshot|edit|latest}/branch_or_snapshot
// if latest then branch is optional, assumed to be "main"
