# Welcome
Welcome to the Datagrove tutorial! In this tutorial you'll create a concierge edgesite for a fictional startup: Sarah's Home Health NP.

## What is Datagrove?

Datagrove is an *edgesite* platform. An edgesite is just a web site with end to end encryption. That means only people you share with are allowed to view or edit the website. Even we can't see it unless you allow us to.

Creating an edgesite is no harder than using a word processor. If you have used Microsoft Word or Google Docs before, you are already overqualified. You can even import your Microsoft Office or Google Workspace documents into your edgesite or export them to support a legacy process.

An edgesite is available even when the internet is not! When your internet is down it's a good time to catch up on those messages you haven't responded to ðŸ˜…

A concierge edgesite lets you host a custom site for each of your clients, but lets you see it as one site. For example if you were a doctor with 200 patients, they each see their own edgesite, but you don't need to visit 200 sites to interact with them. You can interact with it as if it were one site. On their side, they can share their concierge site with whoever they choose; a coworker or spouse can securely join the conversation with no burden to you.

## Making your first identity

You must have at least one identity in order to edit an edgesite. You may have as many as you like. It's not a login, because we don't log it anywhere. It's not a user name because you can change your name any time you like. And it's not exactly a password, because you can never change it.

Your identity will be based on BIP39. Your 12 words will be generated as randomly as possible. Ready? Click!

```<GenerateId/>```

Now write this down. Seriously, write it down. Preferably with a pencil, since inks will generally fade but graphite doesn't. The genius of BIP39 is that even if you can't make out a few characters, your brain will fill in the gaps. So write it down, with a pencil, and keep it safe. That one low tech act trumps all the acronym soup of encryption technology. We offer easy-to-use tools to pass your identity around to your devices without needing this BIP39 code. If all your devices fail simultaneously though, this code will get you access to your data.

## Free Use Limits
> If the product is free, you are the product -- Tim O'Reilly

Using edgesites is always free. Creating documents locally on your PC or phone is also always free. Sharing those documents and keeping them backed up requires a host.

We make available a limited number of hosts for free so people can learn how to build edgesites. These may not stay reliable over time since there's only so much we can do to prevent people from abusing them without invading your privacy. If bad actors choose to attack these sites, they may get slow or even stop. But most of the time we expect people will do the right thing and these free sites will be fine to let you learn. 

You also might find some friendly people in our forums that will loan you access to their host which is likely to give you better performance, though some mutual trust is involved since your host can block your access any time. Even if your host blocks you, your edgesite is safe on your devices and can be transferred to a new host.

A paid host allows you virtually unlimited edgesites, and you can share a host with any number of people. For $6/month you can get 2TB of transfer and 40GB of storage (that's a lot!). You can also self-host using services like Amazon Lightsail, Google Cloud Compute, or countless web hosts.
