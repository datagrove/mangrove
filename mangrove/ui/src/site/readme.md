There is quite a bit of overlap among

1. Intro site that needs no login
2. Personal site that tracks a user's existance in datagrove
3. Starter edge sites that people create
4. Concierge sites split off from the edge site.


It's not clear how to share the documentation among these sites other than copy/paste.
